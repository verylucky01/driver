/*
    define constructor/destructor priority
    The priority ranges from 0 to 65535, with smaller numbers indicating higher priority.
    The destructor has the opposite priority. If not specified, the default priority is the lowest value 65535.
    When priorities are the same, the order of declaration within the same file determines the priority;
    for different files, the order is not guaranteed.
    0-100 is usually reserved for system use.

    svm functions performed inside the constructor/destructor:
    1. device init/uninit svm_register_ioctl_dev_init_post_handle
        Because there is no priority when registering handles, the framework calls them back in the order
        they are registered. Generally, lower-level modules need to be initialized first, so they should
        have a higher constructor priority and be registered with the framework earlier.
        first: dbi, apbi
        hign: va allocator
        medium: handle register: pcie/ub share/op/query
        low: cache malloc, urma_seg_local
        final: others: mms, host/pcie_th register, urma adapt chan/seg init, mem show, task group
    2. submodule global variables init/uninit
        device init is after constructor, so global variables can be initialized independently using default priority.
    3. registration of hook functions for other functionalities between submodules
        a. Use the default priority if there is no impact
           for example: svm_set_agent_init_ops, drv_registert_event_proc
        b. Use the default priority if there is only one register
           for example: svm_normal_set_ops, svm_mng_set_ops, svm_vmm_set_ops, svm_mem_repair_set_ops
        c. ...
